# MinHeap Implementation in Python

This project contains a Python implementation of the MinHeap data structure using bit manipulation for efficient index calculations. The MinHeap class supports various operations such as building a heap, heapifying, and popping the root element, while maintaining the heap property in a generic way that can handle different data types including integers and floats.

## Features

- **Build Min-Heap**: Construct a min-heap from an unsorted list.
- **Pop Root**: Remove the smallest element from the heap and re-heapify.
- **Add Elements**: Insert new elements into the heap while maintaining the heap order.
- **Generic Type Support**: Can handle various data types.
